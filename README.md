# Viral_Infection_CG_Adhesion
Coarse-Grain Dynamice Model for Virus-Host Cell Interactions during cellular adhesion and entry. The square section of the membrane domain is represented as the beads connected with springs. Each os the bead is connected to its 6 neighbors, except for the ones at the end. Virus is represented as an analytical spherical surface.
Spherical_100.py: It is the driver for the case of spherical virions, like Corona along with the Brownian dynamics calculations to describe the folding of the membrane around the virus. This file imports the input values from the following two files
